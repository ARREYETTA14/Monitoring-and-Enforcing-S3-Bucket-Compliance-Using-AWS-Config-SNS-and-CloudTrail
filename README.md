# Monitoring-and-Enforcing-S3-Bucket-Compliance-Using-AWS-Config-SNS-and-CloudTrail
This project demonstrates how to integrate AWS Config with Amazon S3, SNS, and CloudTrail to monitor changes in an S3 bucket's configuration, flag it as non-compliant if it becomes public, send an SNS notification to subscribed email addresses, and use CloudTrail to record the API that triggered the change.
